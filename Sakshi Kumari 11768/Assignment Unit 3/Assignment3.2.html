 Describe the various Control Flow statements in JavaScript, 
specifically highlighting the difference between for, while, and do
while loops. 

1. Types of Control Flow Statements in JavaScript
A. Conditional (Decision-Making) Statements

Used to execute code based on conditions.

if statement
Executes code if a condition is true.

if–else statement
Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise another block.

else if ladder
Checks multiple conditions sequentially.

switch statement
Selects execution paths based on the value of an expression.

B. Looping (Iteration) Statements

Used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

for loop

while loop

do–while loop

(These are explained in detail below.)

C. Jump / Control Transfer Statements

Used to change the normal flow of execution.

break – exits a loop or switch

continue – skips the current iteration and continues with the next

return – exits a function and returns a value

2. Difference Between for, while, and do–while Loops
1. for Loop

Used when the number of iterations is known.

Initialization, condition, and increment/decrement are written in one line.

Condition is checked before executing the loop body.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}


Example:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. while Loop

Used when the number of iterations is not fixed.

Condition is checked before executing the loop body.

Initialization is done outside the loop.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}


Example:

let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3. do–while Loop

Similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after executing the loop body.

The loop body executes at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax:

do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);


Example:

let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);

3. Key Differences (Comparison Table)
Feature	for Loop	while Loop	do–while Loop
Condition check	Before loop	Before loop	After loop
Guaranteed execution	No	No	Yes (at least once)
Best use case	Known number of iterations	Unknown iterations	Execute at least once
Initialization	Inside loop	Outside loop	Outside loop
