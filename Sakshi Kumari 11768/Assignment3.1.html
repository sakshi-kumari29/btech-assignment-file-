//1. Explain the differences between var, let, and const with respect to 
scope and hoisting.
. var

Scope:

Function-scoped, not block-scoped.

A var declared inside a block (if, for, etc.) is accessible outside that block, as long as it’s inside the same function.

if (true) {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // 10


Hoisting:

var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.

They are initialized with undefined.

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

2. let

Scope:

Block-scoped (limited to the block {} where it is declared).

if (true) {
  let y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // ReferenceError


Hoisting:

let is hoisted, but not initialized.

It exists in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until the declaration is reached.

console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 10;

3. const

Scope:

Also block-scoped, just like let.

if (true) {
  const z = 30;
}
console.log(z); // ReferenceError


Hoisting:

const is hoisted but not initialized, and also has a Temporal Dead Zone.

Must be initialized at the time of declaration.

console.log(c); // ReferenceError
const c = 15;
